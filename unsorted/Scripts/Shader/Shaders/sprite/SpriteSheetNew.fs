This simple shader allows you to create a looping animated sheet within High Fidelity
 or any other software that supports a Fragment Shader of the similar type.

//  so if they were ints, the configuration parameters would be completely skipped. Very very annoying.

// Sprite sheet columns

/*
 Frames are defined by Rows So, forexample the above default values would be a sheet with 2 rows and 2 columns.
 The frames would be as:
		 ------------
		| 0 | 1 | 2 | 3 |
		-------------
		| 4 | 5 | 6 | 7 |
		-------------
		| 8 | 9 |10 |11 |
		-------------
