Dot product: 
Gives the cosine 
the magnitude of the projection of A in the direction of B
minus sign if the direction is opposite
SCALAR PROJECTION OF A ONTO B

SOHCAHTOA
sine equals opposite over hyptoenuse
cosine equals adjacent over hypteniuse
tangent equals opposite over adjacent

cos^-1 is the inverse of the cosine 
two normalized angles gives you the cosine  
acos() <--- inverse of the cosine 
*arc cosine*

0 - if perpindicular
-1 - if opposite 
1 - if 

Cross Product:
operation on two vectors
- returns a vector 
Writen as:
C = A X B
C(x) = A(y) * B(z) - A(z) * B(y)
C(y) = A(z) * B(x) - A(x) * B(z)
C(z) = A(x) * B(y) - A(y) * B(x)

A & B define a plane
C is perpindicular to that plane

The order is important
Anticommutative (result swaps)
AXB = C then BXA = - C

Matrices

Good for scale, translation, rotation
M x n - The size of the array 
M - rows / n - columns
Mij - i = row / j = column

Matrix can only be multiplied if:
the number of columns in M1 is equal to the number of rows in M2
