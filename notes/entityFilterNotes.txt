EntityTree::filterProperties
gets auto entityEditFilters = DependencyManager::get<EntityEditFilters>() and calls the filter function
This will just give a bool back
-used in shouldEraseEntity


shouldEraseEntity
We check if you are allowed as the editor(lock/unlock)
- Delete / Edit
Dummy properties are passed so there is no difference between properties and original properties
- allowed T/F

- Used in processEraseMessage and EntityTree::processEditPacketData

processEraseMessage
                if (shouldEraseEntity(entityID, sourceNode)) {
                    entityItemIDsToDelete << entityItemID;
                    cleanupCloneIDs(entityItemID);
                }
            }
            deleteEntities(entityItemIDsToDelete, true, true); 


EntityTree::processEditPacketData
Handles the following -
PacketType::EntityErase
	processEraseMessageDetails -> processEraseMessage -> processEraseMessage -> EntityTree::deleteEntities

PacketType::EntityClone
PacketType::EntityAdd
	isAdd = true (next case) 
PacketType::EntityPhysics
	This does nothing, just falls through to edit
	
PacketType::EntityEdit
	Is it physics - isPhysics = true

return processedBytes;

// Having (un)lock rights bypasses the filter, unless it's a physics result.
- This is for Edit / Add (delete handled differently and physics pass through)

Question about was changed - how is this getting set if it's not being passed by reference?

- We then check if it exists and not added ( for edit )
